# orca-autoencoder

## directory structure for this autoencoder project

My toplevel directory on my **local machine** is titled 'github'


```

  The python scripts are maintained under github in the `orca-autoencoder-codes` sub-directory.
  
  * MLP = Multilevel Perceptron scripts
  * CNN = Convolutional Neural Network scripts

  The rest of this project is stored outside of Github:
  
  * input data for the neural networks are stored in the `spectrograms` sub-directory
  * trained models are stored in the `models` sub-directory;
  * various scripts create jpg files and these are stored in the `jpgs` sub-directry.
  
  **orca-autoencoder_MLP.py** is a fully connected multilayer perceptron network
  **AE_train_256_256.py is BECOMING a ketos style CNN
