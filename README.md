# orca-autoencoder

## directory structure for this autoencoder project

My toplevel directory on my **local machine** is titled 'github'

orca-autoencoder_MLP.py
  
  The python scripts are maintained under github in the orca-autoencoder-codes directory.
  MLP -- Multilevel Perceptron scripts
  CNN -- Convolutional Neural Network scripts

  The rest of this project is stored outside of github.
  Input data for the neural networks are stored in spectrograms
  and trained models are stored in models.
  Various scripts create jpg files and these are stored in jpgs.
  
  **orca-autoencoder_MLP.py** is a fully connected multilayer perceptron network
